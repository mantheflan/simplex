standard simplex algorithm (problem in standard form, no artificial variables)

get number of control variables
get the objective function
get the constraints (assume positivity of control variables)
output to document

form initial tableau
output to document

iterate:
    check cycling
        will have to take care of that later
    check positivity of z-row
        if yes, break
    find entering variable
    compute theta values
        take care with infinities
    find exiting variable
        have a vector with the non-basic variables
    form tableau
    gaussian elimination
    output tableau to document


Need to test:
How does infinity work? That's alright
Sending to a document
Printing a groff document
